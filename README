Fuzzy Control Language (FCL) Library

A basic implementation of the FCL, see doc/.

To compile, run 'make' in the src/ directory.

This should build the exectuable file RunFCL, 
as well as the library libfcl.a. A successful
make will copy the RunFCL to the fuzzy/ directory.

To run a FCL file, three arguments are required:
1) FCL model file  
2) Data input file with values of the fuzzy inputs
3) Output file where results are written

For example, from the fuzzy/ directory:
"./RunFCL data/test.fcl data/test.in test.out"

An optional fourth argument can specify a column
name in the input file that will be used as a label
in the output for each input line.

An optional fifth argument specifies the file delimeter
for parsing the input data file.  Default is a comma.
